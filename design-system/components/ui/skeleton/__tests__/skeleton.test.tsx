// Plan 38-3 Task 2 — composeStories smoke test (FE-QUAL-10).
// One test per exported story; enumerates them automatically so new stories get
// coverage for free. Pure render smoke — interaction tests are Playwright (Plan 38-4).
//
// Assertion shape: render() returning (i.e. not throwing) is the smoke contract.
// Some stories deliberately render null (caps-lock-warning Hidden, icon-count-badge
// ZeroHidden) — those are legitimate states; `container` is always a Node, so the
// test passes when render completes. Using `expect(container).toBeInstanceOf(Node)`
// asserts the smoke happened without imposing visual content.
